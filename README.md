# Machine_Learning-for-Transport-Company
Predict the preferred mode of transport.

Machine Learning Models You work for an office transport company. You are in discussions with ABC Consulting company for providing transport for their employees. For this purpose, you are tasked with understanding how do the employees of ABC Consulting prefer to commute presently (between home and office). Based on the parameters like age, salary, work experience etc. given in the data set ‘Transport.csv’, you are required to predict the preferred mode of transport. The project requires you to build several Machine Learning models and compare them so that the model can be finalised.

Age : Age of the Employee in Years

Gender : Gender of the Employee

Engineer : For Engineer =1 , Non Engineer =0

MBA : For MBA =1 , Non MBA =0

Work Exp : Experience in years

Salary : Salary in Lakhs per Annum

Distance : Distance in Kms from Home to Office

license : If Employee has Driving Licence -1, If not, then 0

Transport : Mode of Transport

The objective is to build various Machine Learning models on this data set and based on the accuracy metrics decide which model is to be finalised for finally predicting the mode of transport chosen by the employee.
